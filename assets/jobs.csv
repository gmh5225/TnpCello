In advance of the launch of the eponymous book published by DelMonico Books, architecture critic Paul Goldberger will discuss the complex design process behind Blue Dream with DS+R partner Charles Renfro and Associate Principal Holly Deichmann. The panel discussion will offer insights into how Blue Dream reinterprets organic architecture for the 21st century, and stands as a striking addition to the roster of architecturally ambitious modernist houses on Long Island.

Paul Goldberger is a Contributing Editor at Vanity Fair. From 1997 through 2011, he served as the Architecture Critic for The New Yorker, where he wrote the magazineâs celebrated âSky Lineâ column. He is the author of numerous books, including BALLPARK: Baseball in the American City, Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, Building with History, Why Architecture Matters, Building Up and Tearing Down, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and DUMBO: The Making of a Neighborhood and the Rebirth of Brooklyn. He also holds the Joseph Urban Chair in Design and Architecture at The New School in New York City and was formerly Dean of the Parsons School of Design at The New School.

He began his career at The New York Times, where in 1984 his architecture criticism was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism. In 2012 he received the Vincent Scully Prize from the National Building Museum in recognition of the influence his writing has had on the publicâs understanding of architecture. In 2017, he received the Award in Architecture of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which called him âthe doyen of American architectural critics.â

Charles Renfro joined Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R) in 1997 and became a Partner in 2004. He was the Partner-in-Charge of Blue Dream, leading the complex design process. He led the design and construction of the studioâs first concert hall outside of the US â The Tianjin Juilliard School in China â as well as the studioâs first public park outside of the US â Zaryadye Park in Moscow. Charles has also led the design of much of DS+Râs academic portfolio, with projects completed at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Brown University, the University of Chicago, and the recently completed Columbia Business School. Charles is also leading the design of two projects in his native Texas: the renovation of Frank Lloyd Wrightâs Kalita Humphreys Theater in Dallas, and Sarofim Hall, a new home for Rice Universityâs Visual Arts department in Houston. Charles is a board member of BOFFO, a nonprofit organization that supports the work of queer LGBTQ+ BIPOC artists and designers. He has twice been recognized with the âOut100â list, and also distinguished as a notable LGBTQ leader by Crainâs New York Business. He is a faculty member of the School of Visual Arts.

Holly Deichmann is an Associate Principal at Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R). She was the Project Director for Blue Dream, overseeing the complex design process alongside Partner-in-Charge Charles Renfro. She was also the Project Architect of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the Project Director for the adjoining Park Union Bridge, a curved steel structure connecting the museum campus to the adjacent America the Beautiful Park. Holly was also the Project Director for the recently-completed Susan Wakil Health Building at the University of Sydney in Australia. She is currently the Project Director for the New Museum of Transport in Budapest, a new home for the museum located on the brownfield site of a former train repair facility.",https://events.umich.edu/event/111190,"Walgreen Drama Center","STAMPS Auditorium","Walgreen Drama Center",,career,"A.

Presented by the Institute for the Humanities, Rackham Graduate School, and the University Career Center, this series of events is intended to support humanities graduate students from across fields in exploring and preparing for the diverse career paths available to them. Students may attend events individually, but may find it especially helpful to attend each in progression.

About today's workshop:
Led by Derek Attig and Mearah Quinn-Brauner, the Humanities Mindsets workshop invites participants to experiment with using humanistic modes of thinking in conversations about jobs and careers. The workshop adapts a form used in many career workshops: having participants reflect on their experiences and the experiences of their peers using shared terms. But instead of an unfamiliar (and potentially alienating) vocabulary of âskillsâ or âvalues,â we guide participants in using theoretical frameworks from the humanities to analyze those experiences. Our hope is that the workshop helps humanists see their working lives as worthy of deep, critical, and playful intellectual engagementâand equips them to help one another to make stronger and more confident career decisions.

Presented by the Institute for the Humanities, Rackham Graduate School, and the University Career Center, this series of events is intended to support humanities graduate students from across fields in exploring and preparing for the diverse career paths available to them. Students may attend events individually, but may find it especially helpful to attend each in progression.

About today's workshop:
With a focus on humanities students, this workshop will provide guidance around cover letters and resumes for positions beyond tenure track roles.

The process of synthesizing your academic experiences into strong application materials for jobs beyond academia can be challenging but rewarding. This workshop is a hands-on opportunity for graduate students to learn how to effectively develop a resume using the foundation that they have laid with information and experiences from their CV. The session will also include strategies for writing compelling, tailored cover letters and thinking strategically about how these two documents complement each other.

To make the most of the session, students should come prepared to discuss and workshop ideas, and have a simple list of their recent experiences and skills they might want to highlight (a CV or past resume would also work).

Competitive gaming, known as esports (and not eSports, e-sports and CERTAINLY NOT e-Sports) is a vibrant industry with viewership number and revenue rivaling that of most traditional sports. Although seemingly a recent development, this ecosystem has been evolving since the arcade leaderboards of the 1980s. As with any instance of rapid expansion, growing pains are frequent and often overwhelming. This talk will examine the current state of the esports industry, discussing and dissecting both the light and the dark side of this captivating space.

Dr. Lindsey Migliore is an esports medicine physician, Senior Director of Gaming & Performance at Evil Geniuses, Founder of GamerDoc, Executive Director of Queer Women of Esports, Faculty Associate for the NYIT Center for Sports Medicine, co-editor of the Handbook of Esports Medicine & SecretLab Ergonomic Advisor.

About this event:
For humanists interested in pursuing diverse career pathways beyond tenure-track roles, the options can sometimes feel overwhelming and abstract. During this session, a panel of alumni from U-M humanities departments working in diverse industries will provide concrete details about their day-to-day work and the career journeys that led them there. The goal is to provide examples of the varied pathways and types of work humanists pursue after graduating with a Ph.D.

Students should come prepared with questions for the panelists, as there will be plenty of time to steer the conversation in directions that are most meaningful for the group.",https://events.umich.edu/event/110457,,,,,Career,"Institute for the Humanities

She's written or edited for the Smithsonian, PBS, Crash Course, and Study Hall, and previously led the editorial team at one of YouTube's biggest science channels: SciShow. In 2021, Alexis launched a new series on YouTube celebrating Michigan's science and history stories, which has since received nearly 3.5 million views.

Despite being a BCN major, Alexis somehow started her science writing journey in the U-M Aerospace Department, and got her first big science writing job through the Michigan Marching Band... and Tumblr. Unsurprisingly, she's now a big fan of applying the skills she learned at Michigan in unexpected ways.
